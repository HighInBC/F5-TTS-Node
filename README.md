# F5-TTS-Node
This is a ComfyUI node to create audio from a sample voice and some text using F5-TTS

This code is in a barely working state. It is cobbled together from AI generated code, stolen code and it is brittle. It technically works. This may be a good starting point for someone who wants to make a proper node.
